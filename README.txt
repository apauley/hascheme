A Scheme interpreter written in Haskell.

This is a toy project written for my own amusement.
Don't try to do anything important with it.

To try it out you need a Haskell compiler and some packages.
The Haskell Platform has everything you need:
http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/

Type "make" in the source dir and then run:
$ ~/bin/hascheme

If you don't want it installed in ~/bin edit the Makefile.

Implementated by following Jonathan Tang's tutorial:
